# Project Constitution: Student Task Board

## Core Principles
- **Specification-Driven:** No feature is implemented without a spec and a plan.
- **Traceability:** Requirements must map directly to implementation tasks.

## Technical Standards
- **Framework:** React with Vite.
- **Language:** TypeScript (Strict Mode).
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS.
- **Persistence:** LocalStorage (No external database).

## Definition of Done
- Feature matches the specification.
- TypeScript types are fully defined (no 'any').
- State persists after browser refresh.
